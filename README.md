# Kids Kata

## Kata for kids is a coding challenge repository aimed at children to help them learn to code

Our aim is to provide easy-to-follow instructions for a multitude a 'Kata' coding challenges targeted at kids and their parents/carers.

With an emphasis on simplicity and access, each Kata should provide 'start from scratch' instructions to help anyone setup quickly and complete there first challenge. Unlike a lot of coding 'games', this repository aims to introduce people to professional coding languages and tools

Rather than your typical Kata which usually involves little more than a brief and expected outcome, Kids Kata will encourage younger kids to work with their parents/carers to discuss what the challenge is trying to get them to consider and steer them through the challenge step by step.

## Target Languages

It is out hope that more languauges can be added for each kata, along with the necessary instructions to set up the required tools in order to complete each challenge. No kata should require any paid-for tools, include any advertising, large downloads or access to the internet in order to execute the code.

Our supported languages and environments (so far) are:

1. C# / Visual Studio Code
2. Python / Visual Studio Code

## Pre-Requisites

Each kata 'environment' (i.e. lanuguage and its tools) should include easy-to-follow instructions to download and set up the tools and pull down the starter projects.
